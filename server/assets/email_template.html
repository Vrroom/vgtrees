            You are being asked to participate in a study on visual perception.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Estimated time: 5 min</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Purpose</h4>
        <p>
            This study aims to understand how humans recognize parts in images,
            specifically in vector images. These images are made of lines,
            curves and shapes. They are used in games and cartoons. Think Tom
            and Jerry. One might draw Jerry's face using circles for the eyes, a
            triangle for the nose and a few lines and curves for the mouth. We
            want to understand how humans make sense of these individual shapes
            and conclude that they are looking at Jerry.
        </p>
        <h4>Procedures</h4>
        <p>The study is divided into two phases.</p>
        <p>
            In the first phase, you'll understand the goals of this study. You
            will complete a tutorial. The tutorial will walk you through our
            annotation interface and teach you how to produce annotations that
            we are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the second phase, you'll use the interface to annotate one image.
            While creating these annotations, keep in mind that we are
            interested in how you perceive similarity between different parts in
            a image.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, in the third phase, you'll be asked to share you
            experiences. You'll fill out a small questionnaire and share
            feedback. Upon completion, you'll be given a survey code which you
            can enter on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website to confirm your
            participation.
        </p>

            interest in computer graphics and related technologies. You will
            also be compensated monetarily.
